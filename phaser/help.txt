HELP: Loading JavaScript Files with <script> Tag
-----------------------------------------------

1. Basic Usage:

To use a JavaScript file in your HTML, add a <script> tag in your HTML file like this:

    <script src="js/game.js"></script>

- `src` specifies the path to your JavaScript file.
- The path can be relative or absolute.
- The file will be executed in the order it appears in the HTML.

---

2. Folder Structure:

If your project has folders, make sure the path matches the file location. Example:

my-game/
├─ index.html
├─ js/
│   ├─ game.js
│   └─ scene1.js
├─ libs/
│   └─ phaser.min.js

HTML example:

    <!-- Load Phaser library -->
    <script src="libs/phaser.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Load your game code -->
    <script src="js/game.js"></script>
    <script src="js/scene1.js"></script>

---

3. Order Matters:

- Scripts are executed in the order they appear.
- If `scene1.js` uses something from `game.js`, `game.js` must be loaded first.

---

4. Inline Scripts:

You can also write JavaScript directly in the HTML without a separate file:

    <script>
        console.log("Hello, Phaser!");
    </script>

- Useful for quick testing.
- For larger projects, keep code in separate `.js` files for organization.

---

5. Notes:

- Paths are case-sensitive on most servers.
- Using multiple JS files allows you to organize your game code (scenes, utilities, etc.).
- Always test your HTML locally to ensure the paths are correct.
